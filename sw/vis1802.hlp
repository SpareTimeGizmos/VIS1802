#DESCRIPTION:
#   This text file is the source for monitor firmware that's built in to the
# VIS1802 video display.  This text is what you see when you type the monitor
# "HELP" command.  This file is converted to a .HEX image by the romtext
# program and then merged into the EPROM image by rommerge.
#
#IMPORTANT!
#   Lines which begin with a "#" are comments and are completely discarded by
# the romtext program, up to and including the newline at the end.  EVERYTHING
# ELSE, including spaces, tabs, newlines, EVERYTHING, gets put into the EPROM!
#
# REVISION HISTORY:
# dd-mmm-yy	who     description
# 29-APR-24	RLA	New file.
# 14-NOV-24	RLA	Clean up and format for 40 columns.
